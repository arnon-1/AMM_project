This repository contains my code for the Monte Carlo project for the Atomistic Modeling of Materials lecture course.

I should note that this is not my cleanest code.

The implementation uses JAX for GPU-accelerated computations. On my laptop, the longest calculation takes only a few seconds.

AI was partially used for documentation and plotting, but all outputs were verified.
