This repository contains my code for the Monte Carlo project for the Atomistic Modeling of Materials lecture course.

The code could use some cleanup, but it should demonstrate the main ideas.

The implementation uses JAX for GPU-accelerated computations. On my laptop, the longest calculation takes only a few seconds.

AI was partially used for documentation and plotting, but all outputs were verified.
